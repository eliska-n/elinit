                            English is the language for coding and presenting myself in the community. However, I simply love my native language and I couldn't resist writing my posts in Czech. And also... You know... I wanted to show it to my mom. Proper localization of the website brought two problems – I cannot do it technically, and my Czech stories don't reflect the English presentation perfectly. Improvement is on my To Do list.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="text-center">Why Elinit? </h2>
                        <p>
                            I have bought elinit.cz domain for one of Czechitas lecture. I didn't know, whether I would ever use it. Thus, I invested just few minutes to creating the name. It is my personal homework on Django. Even though there are many troubles, it is my first programming project and I am very proud seeing it online. Have fun with me, cause that's the only reason for this website. 
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="text-center"> The way it was created and what's next? </h2>
                        <p>
                            If you were interested in coding troubles of one Czech blondie and people who helped her, and platforms that gave her all the education, read through my <a href="http://www.elinit.cz/post/3">first blog post</a>.
                            In my <a href="http://www.elinit.cz/post/4">second post</a> you can learn about all things that work and many more that do not on this website. If you were willing to help me with debugging, I would be greatly grateful for your comment, help or just words of comfort. </br>
                            I plan to post all project on Github when it is ready.</br>
                            If you wanted to become a blogger on this unicorn-full website, I would be the happiest developer! Please don't be frustrated by broken features and non-existent support. It's supposed to be fun and I'd be delighted if someone would share it with me. </br>
                            I would like to add more features to the page. This will depend on my further development and direction. For now, it's an idea and a resolution. Let's be surprised what life brings.
